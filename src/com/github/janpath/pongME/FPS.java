     * Returns the best delay given the specified FPS.
     * The delay is used in application loops and is typically provided to the
     * Thread.sleep() method.
     *
     *
     * The basic formula for this calcuation is as below:
     *
     * delay = 1000 / fps
     *
     * The delay in millseconds, is the product of 1000 milliseconds divided
     * by the desired FPS.
     *
     * Note: To be compatible with the CLDC 1.0 specification this method
     * makes no use of floating point math and therefore the returned delay
     * is always an integral number and may not be the precise result.  The
     * results are precise to within 0.5ms.
     *
     * For example an FPS of 3 should produce a delay of 333.33333ms
     * however this method will return a delay of 333ms.
     *
     * Alternately an FPS of 6 would produce a 166.66666ms delay.  The actual
     * returned delay is 167ms.
     *
     * @param fps The desired frames per second.
     * @return A delay (in milliseconds) within 0.5ms accuracy.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if fps does not fall within 1-60.
